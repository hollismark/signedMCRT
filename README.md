# signedMCRT
Use of signed distance fields in Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer.
This allows modelling of smooth surfaces with out the need to use triangle or similar meshes.

## Example of SDF model produced by signedMCRT

"Ray traced" in signedMCRT where the letters are highly absorbing in a non-scattering/absorbing medium.
